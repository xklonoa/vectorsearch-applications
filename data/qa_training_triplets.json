So in exploring the effects that L-Cetyl-L-Carnitine has, it has a huge variety of effects on cellular metabolism. It can reduce ammonia in the blood. That is actually a quite strong effect. It can reduce things like C-reactive protein, which is you want C-reactive protein levels to be managed. You do not want them too high. It can slightly reduce blood glucose. It can slightly increase HDLC, the good form of the blood lipid, and slightly reduce overall cholesterol. And as I mentioned, it can slightly modify the pathway involving glucagon such that you get a considerable effect, not a huge effect on fat oxidation, so it can improve fat oxidation rates. It has a number of other effects, some of which I talked about during the month on hormones and that sort of thing. It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy and sperm quality. So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things in lots of different cells. It's impacting sperm motility.",

        "anchor": "The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality. Second of all, Momentous Supplements tend to center around single ingredient formulations. This is incredibly important because if you're going to include supplements in your daily regimen, you're going to want to use the right supplements and the right dosages, and you want to do that in the most biologically and cost-effective way. And single ingredient formulations are the only way that you can determine what works and what doesn't work for you. And it's the only way in which you can adjust the dosage of given supplements, or maybe even alternate days that you take one and not the other, in a way that really allows you to home in on which supplements are going to be ideal for your mental health, physical health, and performance. Also, Momentous supplements ship internationally, and that's great because we know a number of you reside outside of the United States. If you'd like to see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.",

Long-term potentiation, or LTP, as the acronym goes, is the strengthening of connections between neurons as a consequence of their repeated firing very closely together in time. Okay, there's a lot more to it, but if you've ever heard the phrase fire together, wire together, sometimes that is misattributed to Donald Hebb, who did talk about neuroplasticity.

Because we know that when hormones and systems of the body are well aligned with the 24-hour schedule, beautiful things happen. And when they are misaligned, terrible things happen. Sometimes those terrible things are subtle at first, but disrupting your circadian rhythms is really bad for every system in your body.

How did these species come about a similar trait in the last 300 million years or 60 million years, depending on who you're talking about. And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that.

So managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar and making sure that you don't lay down too much body fat, making sure your metabolism stays high, making sure you're not getting jittery at meals. It also has to do with making sure that you're creating enough of the molecules, HDL, and not too many of the molecules, LDL, that are going to disrupt the delivery of things to the organs of your body that allow you to make healthy levels of testosterone, estrogen, and so forth. If that wasn't clear, let me make this ultra simple. You want healthy levels of HDL and you want low levels of LDL because if you have ovaries, it will allow the fats that need to get to the ovary to produce estrogen to get there.

I'll explain the neural circuits for dopamine and mindset and dopamine in movement in a moment, but in diseases like Parkinson's or Lewy's body's dementia, which is similar to Parkinson's in many ways, there's a depletion or death of dopamine neurons at a particular location in the brain, which leads to shaky movements, challenges in speaking, challenges in particular in initiating movement. And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere too, people with Parkinson's and Lewy's, excuse me, Louie body dementia also experience drops in motivation and affect, meaning mood.

And cross-sectionally, other people like Elizabeth Hoji have found longer telomeres in the meditators versus the controls. So we haven't really found telomere lengthening in our short-term meditation studies, but we do find boosts in telomerase activity, which is this enzyme that protects our cell aging, slows our cell aging, rebuilds the telomeres.

So let's talk about a few of those studies briefly so I can underscore the value of proper breathing in order to optimize hormones. So I was able to find at least four quality studies showing that when apnea is reduced in sleep or eliminated, there are significant increases in testosterone in males and in proper estrogen to testosterone ratios in females. And the way that it works is very interesting. Apparently it works by reductions in cortisol. Now, cortisol is a stress hormone that is released early in the day as we wake up and serves healthy roles in protecting us against infection, reducing inflammation, et cetera. But you don't want cortisol to be too high and you certainly don't want to elevate it too long throughout the day and night. And so we all know, because now we've been told a lot in the last decade or so, that getting proper sleep is important for all these aspects of health.",

It does have medical purposes and in some places it is legal, but THC increases dopamine and increases neurochemicals that can also create a state of calm. So it's that sort of middle ground. And this paper has a beautiful demonstration whereby not just while people are using cannabis, but depending on how long they've been using cannabis across their lifespan, the rates of eye blinking change.",

And a lot of people, the majority of people that were taking those drugs were not getting relief. So there was a real urgent need to find other drugs for the treatment of depression. And ketamine, at least based on its apparent profile of being a dissociative anesthetic, would seem like the last drug that you'd want to use to treat depression, right? It dissociates people. We even hear about dissociation as a symptom of depression. And yet what happened was a small number of very pioneering clinicians started to explore the use of ketamine in the clinic for the treatment of depression, and in particular for depression that did not respond to any other treatment. So there was a real critical need to find other compounds and a bit more motivation to test some of these, let's call them atypical compounds for the treatment of depression.",

It tends to give a not so subtle, but very transient increase in feelings of wellbeing and alertness and motivation. And that's because of the increase in dopamine caused by nicotine directly within the nucleus accumbens. Nicotine also triggers the release of certain neurochemicals from the ventral tegmental area itself. And those impinge on nucleus accumbens and increase dopamine levels further. This is what makes the rewarding properties or sometimes referred to as the reinforcing properties of nicotine so powerful. This is why so many billions of people ingest nicotine in one form or another. It's also why nicotine is so hard to quit because there's a potent increase in dopamine from multiple neural circuit pathways within this mesolimbic reward circuitry. Now, within the mesolimbic reward circuitry, there's an interesting feature. There are accelerators that essentially push out more dopamine, get more dopamine released, and there are breaks of the so-called GABAergic variety. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.",

And maybe even, in fact, even not experience the pain to the same degree or even at all. So these van Economo neurons sit at a very important junction within the brain. They pay attention to what's going on in your body, pain, pleasure, et cetera. And that includes what's going on with your limbs and your limb range of motion. They also are paying attention and can control the amount of activation, kind of alertness or calmness that you are able to create within your body in response to a given sensory experience.

I, or the patient in this case, recites or repeats over and over the traumatic event or the fearful event. I'm doing that in the presence of a lower amplitude response. Remember back to where we talked about how the retelling works best if the first time it's done, there's a huge amplitude response. And then with each successive repeat, that response, the threat response gets lower and lower. With EMDR, you're sort of short circuiting, you're kind of sneaking around the corner of that high amplitude response.

So let's talk about expectation and anxiety because those two things are somewhat tethered. There are now a number of solid experiments, both in animal models and in humans, that point to the fact that if we know a painful stimulus is coming, that we can better prepare for it mentally and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response. However, the timing in which that anticipation occurs is vital for this to happen. And if that timing isn't quite right, it actually can make the experience of pain far worse. So here I'm summarizing a large amount of literature, but essentially if subjects are warned that a painful stimulus is coming, their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced. However, if they are warned just two seconds before that pain arrives, it does not help. It actually makes it worse.

Whereas the outer more reasoning functions of problem solving functions between a fox and a human are vastly different. And so the physical requirements of those brain outputs are different. I think I heard Elon describe it as the human brain is essentially a monkey brain with a supercomputer placed on the outside, which sparks some interesting ideas about what neocortex is doing. We have all this brain real estate on top of all that more stereotyped function type stuff in the deeper brain. And it's still unclear what neocortex is doing. In the case of frontal cortex, as you mentioned earlier, it's clear that it's providing some quieting of impulses, some context setting, rule setting, context switching.

And John, who I have the good fortune to know, has described to me experiments, or I should say observations of species of ocean dwelling animals that have, at least for the early part of their life, a very robust and complicated nervous system.

But again, at best, that's a tool to aim in the direction that I'm talking about now with respect to meditation, which relates to more what I would call mindfulness generically and ultimately kind of non-dual mindfulness. So mindfulness generically and for most people, certainly in the beginning, dualistically is just the practice of paying careful attention to whatever is arising on its own. Now, in the beginning, it's natural to take a single object like the breath as a starting point. It's kind of an anchor.",

Well, you're going to need energy and you're going to need oxygen. But the way to answer a question, like what allows us to endure, right? Endurance. What allows us to keep going? Well, we think of things like willpower, but what's willpower? Willpower is neurons. It's neurons in our brain. We have this thing called the central governor, which decides whether or not we should or could continue or whether or not we should stop, whether or not we should quit. Okay. So whether or not you're somebody who has a lot of what we would call resilience and endurance, or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early and quits early or can't handle frustration that has to do with your fuel utilization in specific neurons.

If you think of the body as a series of bands pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, you're being pulled into one direction or the other just by the balance of tension from one weak area to one dominantly tight area.

This is a area that more appropriately is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the CTZ or area post-tremor and neurons in this area actually will trigger the vomiting reflex. So the way that the gut and the brain communicate is both chemical and mechanical, and it can be both for sake of increasing certain types of behavior. Today, we're talking mainly about feeding behavior up until now anyway, but also ceasing to eat, closing your mouth, moving away from food, turning away from food, all behaviors that we're familiar with anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation of this mechanosensor for gastric distress.

And ideally, you might even throw in one more wall at the end if you're really feeling bold and brave, because that's going to build out further resilience. But if you want cold exposure to work for you for sake of building up resilience and mental toughness over time, you're going to want to vary this parameter space in some sort of way. And you don't have to be super systematic about it. That's the beauty of this kind of approach, because you're relying on the fact that those walls really represent times in which you are forcing your top-down control, your prefrontal cortex to clamp down on your reflex and you're learning behavioral control in the context of your body having elevated levels of these catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine.",

To illustrate how dopamine works, I want to highlight some very important work largely carried out by the laboratory of a guy named Wolfram Schultz. The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens of excellent experiments on the dopamine system and have identified something called reward prediction error. Although in some sense, you can think about it as reward prediction variance, changes in the levels of dopamine, depending on whether or not you expect a reward and whether or not you get the reward. So I'm going to make this very simple. Dopamine is released into the brain and body and generally makes us feel activated and motivated and as if we have energy to pursue a goal. And it is released into the brain and body in anticipation of a reward. Measurements of dopamine have been made in animals and humans. And what you find is that when we anticipate a reward, dopamine is released. We will put in the work to achieve that reward. That work could be mental work or physical work, but when the reward arrives, dopamine levels drop back down to baseline. That's right. When we receive a reward, dopamine levels go back down to baseline.",

        "anchor": "So for instance, it's now known that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset some of the benefits of exercise. And that makes sense because a lot of the adaptive benefits of exercise actually come from experiencing a lot of inflammation acutely. That means you actually want inflammation during your resistance training workout or even your endurance workout. But then that inflammation triggers an adaptation event or series of adaptation events that leads to greater strength, greater speed, more muscle, more endurance, whatever it is that you happen to be training for. So reducing pain can be good, of course, but not if you have to take more and more of a given drug that it has side effects on the liver and can offset the effects of exercise and so forth. The other issue with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs is that many of them simply do not work for many people, or again, they'll work the first time and the second time, but then they stop working. They also tend to lower body temperature. I think most people are aware of this because many of these same drugs are used in order to reduce fever.",

I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long-term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.",

They generally underestimated how long they had been in this very odd environment with no clocks or watches or exposure to sunlight or regular rhythms of artificial light.

I was reading up on the biology of the Cremaster muscle, something I never thought I'd spend too much time on, but that I ended up spending far too much time reading up about. And it's really fascinating. What you have is a muscle that's a smooth muscle tissue, unlike skeletal muscle, which is striated muscle, that is temperature dependent. So it has certain nerve endings and it has certain receptors on it that allow it to respond to local temperature and then to relax in order to essentially let the testicles to descend further from the body or to contract and bring the testicles closer to the body in order to try and maintain the optimal temperature range.",

So there's an intraoral between ears time difference. And there's a brainstem area in which signals from one ear and signals from the other ear converge. And there's literally a math done by your nervous system that says this signal arrived before the other signal. And the difference between those signals is the intraoral time difference.",

You can't see yourself in time to make an adjustment with a movement that's happening that fast.

And so this is a big component to using technology for exercise at all, is you have to make sure that the end point is you understanding you and your physiology more, not less. When you outsource learning to technology, and in this case, even if the technology is the mirror, you remove your ability to gain and truly understand that learning process.

You know, the origin is that prostate cancer is thought to be or is sort of androgen-mediated One of the Nobel Prizes, again, decades ago was awarded because it was found that when we lowered a man's testosterone, the prostate cancer would regress dramatically.

And within seconds, you actually can start to panic. It also becomes very hard to coordinate your action after a little while. Again, be really careful with this, but it will teach you in a moment, in a very real world way, how important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide because you're probably not running out of oxygen at those lower intensities. You're simply building up carbon dioxide and that gas reflex is screaming to go off and you're actively suppressing it. Yeah. So the interesting test here is your CO2 tolerance.

So I think you're spot on with the suggestion, get some morning daylight, try to get that exposure, usually at least 30 to 40 minutes. There was some great work recently coming out in the occupational health domain where they moved workers from offices that were just facing walls and, you know, didn't have any exposure to natural daylight.

And certainly if they're going to want to conceive children in the distant future, that they consider freezing their sperm because that too is fairly nominal cost in order to freeze sperm at a younger age. And of course, if you can freeze and use sperm from the time in which you were younger, why wouldn't you, right? I mean, you can still opt to go for natural pregnancy later if that's what you want to do, but having that in reserve is generally a good idea. And I discussed some of the parameters that are looked for, and perhaps most importantly, there is the possibility of an underlying issue whereby, for instance, there is very little sperm in an ejaculate.

Even though men make almost 10 times as much or even more than 10 times, it is so important for women. It is essential to so many things, not just sex drive and muscle mass and seeing a response to resistance training, but also confidence and agency. And so those women who are so sensitive to their testosterone level, they've got this high sex hormone binding globulin, their testosterone declines. What they describe is vaginal dryness, maybe a decline in sex drive, but there's also this bigger issue related to confidence and agency, even risk-taking from studies that we've done with MBA students that I think is a serious problem.

However, people quickly develop a tolerance to those drugs and need to consume more and more of them in order to get the effect that they initially got from a lower dosage. And they are not just highly habit-forming, they are highly addictive. And we can distinguish between habit-forming and addictive by simply saying that addictive means people will continue to take something or do something despite negative consequences. There are other relevant definitions of addiction as well. I define addiction more broadly as the progressive narrowing of the things that give you pleasure.

        "anchor": "But my levels indicate that it's within reference range. Okay, so why would I want to take something that would increase the activity of an estrogen receptor? I just can't find the rationale for that. The main rationale behind taking a CIRM is as a very temporary measure that is not going to suppress pituitary or hypothalamic function. If your testosterone is just so drastically low that it is unlikely to recover anyway. So most of the time, it is not clinically useful, and CIRM should not be prescribed very often, certainly not as long-term testosterone replacement or testosterone optimization in most individuals. There's always exceptions to everything, but there's five different estrogen and estrogen-related receptors. There's two main estrogen receptors, and Clomid and EveryCerm has a very unique profile because they selectively inhibit some receptors in some tissues, but not other receptors in other tissues. For example, Clomid can inhibit receptors that are in the eye and it can cause visual changes, blurry vision, especially at higher doses. And it also acts in every other tissue of the body. So side effects from Clomid and other selective estrogen receptor modifiers are very common.",

But this behavior or this practice rather is teaching us to use our visual system and thereby our cognitive system and thereby our reward systems to orient to different locations in space and therefore different locations in time. And that is the essence of goal-directed behavior. That is the essence of setting a goal. It's about thinking about what you want. Then it's about setting milestones that are intermediate to that goal. Then it's about assessing whether or not you're reaching those milestones. And then it's of course about updating your goals if you need to update your goals. All of that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges if you think about it all at once. But if you break it down into these elements that the visual system can help you find and move towards those milestones, I think there's ample evidence to support that. And that your control over your visual system is indeed yours, that you can deliberately set it to different locations.",

The other compound that's relevant both to men and women, or I should say people that are trying to optimize testosterone and or estrogen is Fidogia. Fidogia agrestis is actually an herb that increases the levels of what's called luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone is a hormone that's released from the hypothalamus within the brain that travels to the gonads, either the ovaries or the testes, to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone. And Fidogea agrestis has been shown, albeit in a limited number of studies, to increase levels of luteinizing hormone and thereby levels of testosterone and estrogen in ways that some people find beneficial.

And it's really kind of gone way outside the lane lines. So today we're going to clean up a lot of that. Let's make it really simple about how the vagus actually works, at least as we understand it today in 2021. First of all, as I mentioned, you have sensory information, the same way that you detect light with your eyes or you hear sounds with your ears, you have sensors in your gut that sense how full or empty your gut is.

It seems that when we don't engage in challenges that the anterior mid-singulate cortex, it doesn't atrophy, but it undergoes sort of a downshift in activation. Now, here's what's really, really interesting and relates to the previous question. The anterior mid-singulate cortex seems to be especially active at baseline and available for plasticity in what are called super-agers. Super-agers, you know, we've all heard of blue zones. The super-agers are these people who, they don't just exist in blue zones. They're spread around the world.

And this theory is olfaction inspired in its beginning. That is, I mean, if you think of the mammalian brain, right? Which evolved from olfaction, it's sitting there and in olfaction, because olfaction depends on sniffing, you have this situation where you have a sniff, you have information, and then flat, nothing, right? And then you have information and then nothing. So information processing is one-to-one linked to nasal inhalation. And we think that this property evolved to be meaningful in brain processing in general, not only of olfactory information, but of any type of information, because the brain evolved in this way, in this way that it processes information on inhalation onset.

Nicotine replacement can be used in a similar way, but in a benevolent way in order to help you get over smoking or vaping. By keeping the total amounts of dopamine variable around the clock and by changing the amount of dopamine that's released, it seems to help people behaviorally and psychologically because they don't come to expect having a particular amount of dopamine in their brain and blood at any given time. And this is an important point because it brings us to this notion of homeostasis. Homeostasis is this tendency for biological systems to try and reach equilibrium. What goes up goes down, et cetera, and to some extent to the same degree. So I'll talk about this right now in the context of nicotine use, withdrawal, and then the period in which people no longer crave nicotine. So you can imagine that if we were to measure your heart rate, your blood pressure, and your overall levels of alertness and wellbeing and mood, let's just give that some value.

But I have to acknowledge that the auditory system, and in particular, the circuits in the brain that respond to music have a remarkably potent ability to evoke these emotional states, which is why when surveys have been done asking people why they listen to music, the responses that have come back generally resemble the following statistics. Approximately 90% of people say they listen to music to relax. Approximately 82% of people self-report that they listen to music in order to make themselves happy.

And that has to do with how sugar is metabolized in the brain, or I should say how glucose is used.

After all, a lot of dopamine and serotonin is released and it can be depleted. But I should point out, depletion of a neuromodulator in the short term is not the same thing as depletion of that neuromodulator in the longterm, nor is it the same as loss of the neurons that release dopamine and serotonin itself. So there are data pointing to the fact that repeated administration of MDMA at dosages that are very much within lines with what we're talking about today, 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight can lower total amounts of serotonin or other proteins in the serotonin synthesis pathway or dopamine or proteins that are in the dopamine synthesis pathway in specific areas of the brain related to reinforcement, related to mood, related to motivation, et cetera.",

And so this is a shout out to all the coaches, thank you for doing what you do. However, there needs to be, at least what the scientific literature say, there needs to be a period of each training session whereby the athlete or the person of any kind can simply pay attention to their errors without their attention being cued to something else. A really well-trained coach will say, oh, you know, your elbow's swinging too high, or you're not gripping the racket in the appropriate way, et cetera. They can see things that the practitioner can't see. And of course that's vitally important. But the practitioner also needs to use this error recognition signal. They need to basically focus on something and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on. So put simply, there needs to be a period of time in which it's just repetition after repetition after repetition.",

Naps can have some really great benefits. We found benefits for cardiovascular health, blood pressure, for example. We found benefits for levels of cortisol. We found benefits for learning and memory and also emotional regulation. How long are the naps typically in those studies? Anywhere between 20 minutes to 90 minutes. Sometimes we like to use a 90 minute window so that the participant can have a full cycle of sleep and therefore they get both non-REM and REM sleep within that time period. Then when we wake them up, we usually wait a period of time to get them past what we call sleep inertia, which is that kind of window of grogginess where you say to your better half, look, you know, darling, please don't speak to me for the first hour.

So I don't mind that people do this, but one problem is when people are following ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep and they have trouble with sleep or they're doing long bouts of fasting and they're having trouble falling asleep, it makes sense. It's because their autonomic arousal is tilted towards epinephrine release, norepinephrine release, and dopamine release. So they have a lot of energy, but they have a hard time calming down and getting into deep sleep. I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates and it also replenishes glycogen. So again, you know, I'm not trying to draw any fire, but if I do, I'd be happy to have a conversation about all that.

Well, you could play with this if you want. I don't see any real challenge to this provided the odor is a safe one and it doesn't wake you up and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up. You could do this by having a metronome, for instance, while learning something, playing in the background or particular music, and then have that very faintly while you sleep.

And then I always say the master circadian clock informs all the cells and tissues of your body and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm. But what I've never answered was how it actually puts them into that rhythm. And it does it two ways. One is it secretes a peptide. A peptide is just a little protein that floats through the bloodstream and signals to the cells, okay, we're tuning your clock kind of like a little, you know, in a watch store, the watch store owner would tune the clocks. But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature under which those cells exist. So temperature is actually the effector of the circadian rhythm. Now, this is really important because changes in temperature by way of exercise, by way of eating, but especially by way of exercise can start to shift our circadian rhythm pretty dramatically.",

You know, there can be a sort of, let's say, intimate interactions between people where you wouldn't really want to be super inhibited about it, right? You would want to be disinhibited and impulsive. I can also imagine like sort of fight or flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right?",

And mice tended to seek out mating more and mate more. There were also increases in gonadal weight, literally increases in testes size and in ovarian size when mice were exposed to this UVB light past a certain threshold. Now, as I mentioned before, the study also looked at humans. They did not look at testes size or ovarian size in the human subjects. However, because they are humans, they did address the psychology of these human beings and address whether or not they had increases in, for instance, aggressiveness or in passionate feelings and how their perception of other people changed when they were getting a lot of UVB light exposure to the skin. So before I get into some of the more important details of this study and how it was done and how you can leverage this information for yourself, if you desire, I just want to highlight some of the basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased these so-called sex steroid levels in mice and humans. The sex steroid hormones, when we say steroids, we don't mean anabolic steroids taken exogenously.",

So shortened lifespan, increased mood disorders, increased actually morbidity and mortality for diseases like cancer or heart disease that, you know, might not be what we would normally think. And so I think understanding how each of those processes is happening, those mechanisms are far from being worked out. But the correlational evidence is undeniable. We're now taking this into the lab really for the first time. And so something so simple as social isolation, how come we don't know way more about it? And I'm someone who stumbled into the field of social isolation by accident prior to the pandemic.

I think those are both speculating, but you have to pass through this sort of like, you know, reality shattering, including your sense of self. And one can handle that in one of two ways.

So volatile sounds oftentimes like emotionally volatile, but it just means that they're floating around out there. So when you actually smell something, like let's say you smell a wonderfully smelling rose or cake, yes, you are inhaling the particles into your nose. They're literally little particles of those chemicals are going up into your nose and being detected by your brain. Also, if you smell something putrid, disgusting, or awful, use your imagination, those particles are going up into your nose and being detected by neurons that are part of your brain.

We find that it leads to a boost in motivation, boost endurance, it boosts perseverance, okay? When you frame something in terms of avoidance, success is met with feelings of calm and relief. So kind of like a, ooh, wipe the forehead, like, thank goodness I avoided that calamitous outcome, or thank goodness I avoided doing that really bad thing. Back to neutral. Yeah, exactly. And so it is fine to frame goals in terms of avoidance. And actually, sometimes it's just personality dependent. Like some people are more driven by fear or they need a lot more urgency to drive them. But it is important to know that the approach orientation is on average more motivating. And so you might want to think of reframing your goal in terms of approach versus avoidant. The other advantage to approach is that when you frame something as avoidant, right?

Unless someone's monitoring them, then people don't tend to monitor themselves completely enough that they punish themselves completely enough that they break the behavior. In other words, the punishment isn't bad enough in order to break the habit, which just speaks to how powerful these habits are once they become reflexive. They're just very, very hard to override. So it turns out that the key to generating long-term depression in these pathways is actually to take the period immediately following the bad habit execution. Meaning, let's say you tell yourself, you're not going to pick up your phone. You're not going to bite your nails. you're not going to reflexively walk to the refrigerator at a particular time of day, but you find yourself doing it anyway. And what actually has to happen is bringing conscious awareness to the period immediately afterward, which I think most people recognize. They realize, oh, I just did it again.",

The reason for that is that lactate shows up to the site of the burn, so to speak, and it acts as a hormonal signal for other organs of the body in a very positive way, okay? As you may recall from a very early episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, I talked about what a hormone is and how it works. We have lots of different kinds of hormones, but hormones are chemicals that are released in one location in the body and travel have effects on lots of other organs of the body.

And then in depression, it looks like the left dorsolateral does not sufficiently clamp down on it. And what therapy appears to do is to kind of restore that. What we see with TMS over that region is that we just exogenously do the same sort of thing. We restore the governance of the left dorsolateral over the cingulate area, and that is correlated with treatment improvement. So the degree in which you can re-time, re-regulate in time the left dorsolateral over the cingulate, the more of an antidepressant effect you have.

Earlier, we talked about whether or not to train if you're sleep deprived and how to recover from what I would say is moderate sleep deprivation by doing NSDR as opposed to total sleep deprivation, like being up all night or having a truly miserable night, which case I think you should just skip training the next day and slide it forward. Now, a similar issue comes up from time to time where people wonder whether or not they should train or not if they are sick. Here, there's all sorts of crazy gym lore and sport-specific lore.

Is that true? Yes and no. So a couple of things there. Remember, in order to grow a muscle, there's multiple steps here. So you have the signaling response, which actually happens within seconds of exercise and can last, depending on the marker, up to an hour or two hours. Step number two then is gene expression. And we see that that's typically peaked around two to six hours post-exercise. And then you have following that protein synthesis. And that's that longer timeframe, somewhere between 12 hours there.

Because I don't, trust me, as a scientist, I wish I could keep things as simple as possible. That's what good science is. It turns out the serotonin is produced by neurons in another part of the brain with this wonderful name called the dorsal raphe nucleus. And it turns out the serotonin neurons talk to the dopamine neurons and influence the dopamine neurons. And so it's again, the point we made earlier in your podcast, even though it's fun and useful, both for your listeners and as scientists to think about these powerful chemical messengers in isolation, because that's how we can make progress scientifically. It's how your audience can understand some of the concepts that have been elucidated from brain research over the decades. But they don't work in isolation. They influence each other. They communicate with each other. We're actually doing studies showing that serotonin release in the accumbens actually modulates dopamine release.",

They also make connections within the retina. They connect to things like, this is for the aficionados, the ciliary body, the iris, the muscles, and the structures within the eye that actually move the lens and allow you to adjust your vision to things up close or far away. And in doing so, they increase or improve the health of the little tiny muscles within the eye that move the lens. And they probably, again, this needs a little bit more work in order to really tamp down the mechanism. They're probably also involved in bringing growth factors and blood supply to the muscles and to the neurons that are responsible for this focusing mechanism within the eye.

And they've identified what they call the four horsemen of relationships. These are things that essentially almost always predict that a couple will break up.

So when you take melatonin or a child takes melatonin, oftentimes they are taking supraphysiological levels of melatonin, which at least by my read and the literature says that it could have dramatic effects on timing and course of things like puberty. So it's not so much that the journals have come out saying, oh, taking that melatonin inhibits puberty.

So this is why I always say behavioral tools really should come first. I don't say that because I dislike pharmacology. I say that because in many cases, behavioral tools are not only safer and easier to titrate, to adjust the duration, et cetera, than is pharmacology, but also because they can sometimes, as in the case of the study we just described, afford you more specificity, not less than pharmacology. Pharmacology has its place, can be wonderful, provided safe and legal, et cetera, but it can cause a lot of so-called off-target effects. So for those of you that are interested in increasing creativity through pharmacology, I would say stay tuned for the data on psilocybin and microdosing psilocybin. If you are absolutely obsessed with the idea of microdosing psilocybin for enhancing creativity, and you'd like to go straight to the study, I will tell you what that study is.",

And so in 2005, a group published in Neuron, a paper demonstrating that if you stimulate with the hippocampal rhythms through a TMS coil, you can excite the brain with memory rhythms and it'll last an hour. So you can change cortical excitability in this thumb twitch for an hour, sending three minutes of excitatory or 40 seconds in the case of inhibitory stimulation that mimics the hippocampal rhythms. So much more efficient than the original TMS approaches. And so, you know, after that group tried to do it in this kind of six week schedule.",

And acetylcholine, which you'll soon learn is involved in states of focus and can actually open up. It can literally create states in the mind in which your brain is more plastic and able to change and learn more quickly? Well, acetylcholine can do that on its own, but rarely does it do it on its own. More typically, it gets assistance from some of the other neuromodulators. Now that might seem like it complicates the picture, but it actually makes the picture far simpler because what we can say for sure is that the fast actions of dopamine or the fast actions of epinephrine, serotonin, or acetylcholine are actions that occur on the order of seconds or minutes or up to about an hour or so.",

And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature as it relates to hormones and psychological states and behavior. Now, of course, it is the case that if testosterone is low, that a person or an animal will exhibit less aggressive behavior, but that's not because of reduced testosterone per se, it's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone. Meaning if there's no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower. So we've established that it's not testosterone, but testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression. But nonetheless, it's still surprising, right?

And if we have the answers, then we can bring things into better alignment and then we're in a better place. Those pillars are more stable and we can build on top of them what we want to build on top of them and the drives come better into line that we can do that and it can be an iterative process of if we attain some better state of mind and life is better and we're happy. This happens to people. There's a lot of contentment and peace and if things are going well and now something isn't as much, go back and look again, right? It's a process we can use over and over because it works because it fits with the truths and the reality as we have understood, learned them, you know, our education, the, you know, this learning about humans that across hundreds of years tells us this.

So the simple version of this is get your breathing right. So how do you do that? How do you get your breathing right? Well, for some people that have severe sleep apnea, they're going to need the CPAP machine. This is a machine that you actually put on your face and it helps you breathe properly and sleep. Many people, however, are starting to do this thing of taping their mouth shut. Now, this sounds a little bit extreme and you certainly don't want to do this in any way that's dangerous. James Nestor talked about this in his book, Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art, that simply taping shut the mouth with some tape that will allow you to open your mouth if you really need to during sleep can allow people to shift over from being mouth breathers and snorers to nose breathers. In the daytime, the best way to get good at nasal breathing is to dilate the nasal passages because a lot of people have a hard time breathing through their nose.",

Impacting those meiotic spindles inside the eggs, which hold the chromosomes in their perfect position. They are associated, they get wear and tear from things that cause inflammation or are toxic. So cigarette smoke, we know, decreases egg quality, egg quantity, increases miscarriage, and then of course has fetal impacts. Could I just ask you, because when we talk about, there's nicotine, which itself is not carcinogenic, and then there's the smoking process, which brings in a bunch of other things. The question I know is burning in everybody's mind is vaping, right? Because vaping is, I'm very bullish on this. I mean, it's very clear that the chemicals associated with vaping are just oh so bad for everybody's health. But it's distinctly different from saying that nicotine is bad for one's health. And it can be. But without doing too much of a deep dive, are there any data that show that vaping is bad for egg quality?",

So they asked them to get a lot of outdoor light exposure. They didn't give them a specific amount, but they said maximize outdoor light exposure during the mornings, the time before noon. And again, they had them waking up two to three hours before their habitual wake up time. They were also told, and this is very important if you're going to shift your schedule earlier, to try and keep sleep wake times fixed between their work days and their weekends. So not sleeping in on the weekends or not having any sleep in days, regardless of how well they slept the night before. How fixed? Within 15 to 30 minutes of their predesignated time.",

And so basically the omega-3 fatty acids provide the substrate for some key building blocks of nerve cells and other cells in the brain and body. And, and this is perhaps the most important reason I can think of, when you get out past one gram of the EPA form of omega-3, okay, one gram of EPA form of omega-3 per day. It's clear there's a either mild to moderate antidepressant effect, so much so that one can, in some cases, talk to your psychiatrist or psychologist, partially offset the dosage of any antidepressant. I am not telling you to go off antidepressant medication and go on to fish oil. That is not what I'm saying.

So I think that most people, including myself, hear the opioid crisis and assume that what we really should be doing is seeking a better alternative. But what I'm hearing from you is that there are use cases where opioids make a great deal of sense and that they've really helped improve people's lives and that none of what I just described or anything like it is experienced by those people. In fact, quite the opposite. Do I have that right? Perfectly. And that's, again, where we need to treat these at an individual level on a case-by-case basis and that one size doesn't fit all.

The logic then is by taking epitalin, you can mimic this peptide that's normally released from a nice, young, healthy pineal. And in that sense, encourage anti-inflammation pathways as well as cellular longevity pathways. That's the basic idea. And again, it rests largely on the animal data for which, yes, there's some interesting studies showing suppression of age-related ocular diseases. There's some nice studies showing telomere expansion. There's some nice studies showing that several features of brain aging and body aging can indeed be partially offset by things like epithelium peptides, but it is indeed a leap that people are taking when they are deciding or taking epithelium in order to extend their life, right? The logic is all there, but the pieces are sort of cluged together between what we know about the animal studies, what we know about the naturally occurring compounds that these peptides are designed to mimic.",

I can get this very easily from pictures of people and things like Costello that I really enjoy, trips that I've taken. So you can extend pleasure without having to engage in the behavior over and over. That's extending the arc of that dopamine release. As well, it offsets some of the pain of not having that experience occur over and over and over again. Now, for the high performers out there, you're probably familiar with this.

And one of the symptoms in particular that they found that was reduced was the pain-related symptoms associated with headache. And they actually had some very nice hypotheses as to why that likely would be. And in fact, point out that in earlier studies, omega-3 fatty acids have actually been considered as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases. And indeed, there are prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids. And I highlight that not because I think people need to run out and get the prescription form of omega-3 fatty acids. They're actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive, but because I think oftentimes when we're talking about something like omega-3 fatty acids, the fact that they are available over the counter in a supplement or by liquid or available in food for that matter leads many people to conclude that, oh, you know, this is supplementation.",

Yes, there is. Do I understand what's going on with acupuncture? Having completed an NIH-funded acupuncture study? Yeah, I just saw that published. No. I'm just being straight. We still don't know exactly how acupuncture is working. We do know that there's a nice study that showed activation of peripheral adenosine receptors that have a peripheral analgesic effect.

The other question I had about the next pandemic and the one we just had is why not have committees of people of diverse backgrounds, socioeconomic diversity, racial diversity, every aspect of diversity rather than individuals standing there telling us what to do for several reasons. One is we are a country of many different people. I think there are dozens, if not hundreds of scientific papers showing that patients follow the advice of doctors that look like them and sound like them or to whom they would aspire to be like. We know this. And yet public health officials typically are unitary. One person telling us, do this, don't do that. This is a good idea, that's a bad idea.

There are other approaches too, of course, but there are many people who are experimenting with supplementing with glutamine several grams per day, often even five grams distributed through three or four different servings throughout the day as a way to blunt their sugar cravings. Now, there has not yet been a large-scale clinical trial using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings, but the results of the few studies that I looked at, as well as my understanding of the logic of these neural circuits, including the neuropod cells, brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense why, if there's a population of neurons within our gut that responds very robustly to the presence of sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids, that the intake of particular amino acids would allow the dopamine pathways that might otherwise be triggered by sugar to be triggered by something like glutamine, which has very few or no calories.",

People were asked about their level of depression relief immediately after, one week after, two weeks after, three weeks after. And the degree of relief tended to change over time. In fact, it tended to diminish over time, but it was also stable or remarkably stable, I should say, at least by my read, in the 25 milligram dose group. And that is summarized nicely in figure two of the paper, because they explored these people's levels of depression out to week 12, and they still saw a significant degree of depression relief 12 weeks after the single 25 milligram psilocybin dose session. So as I mentioned earlier, there are now about a dozen or so excellent studies, clinical trials, exploring the use of single or two session psilocybin treatment in that 25 to 30 milligram range, which seems to be the most effective dose for long lasting relief from depression.",

Okay. Meaning that is it, it's that at the time of day, so is it a circadian process where it's just nighttime nurse means that you release growth hormone or is it nighttime plus sleep that is needed?

I know it sounds really esoteric, but that's actually where it's found in nature and and is really 99% L-DOPA.

It does increase alertness and mood. It might even increase libido, motivation, et cetera. But the effects of mucunipurines tend to be very much of the increasing the peak in dopamine and then very quickly dropping that peak. In other words, the peak trough phenomenon, not for increasing baseline levels of dopamine. Now, it's likely different for people with Parkinson's who are taking prescription drugs that are similar to mucunipurine.

So this concept is referred to as hormesis, right? This is a a little bit of stressful challenge that activates these stress response pathways in a beneficial way that is a net positive that actually, you know, it has a very profound antioxidant, anti-inflammatory response or, you know, or whatever the response is. It could be the production of more stem cells. These are cells that help regenerate different cells within tissues or something like autophagy, which is a process that can clear away all the gunk inside of our cells, pieces of DNA, protein aggregates. So you'll find that these stress response pathways are activated by a variety of stressors. So for example, one pathway is called heat shock proteins. And as their name would apply, one would go, oh, they're activated by heat. Well, correct. They are activated very robustly by heat.",

I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep, that is getting a great night's sleep, is the foundation of all mental health, physical health, and performance. When we're sleeping well, everything goes far better. When we are not sleeping well or enough, everything gets far worse at the level of mental health, physical health, and performance. And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is that you have to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, you need your core body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees.",

And I hope that this is an area that researchers are going to pursue in the very near future because many of the treatments for reducing DHEA or increasing testosterone or reducing cortisol have already made it through FDA approval. They're out there, they're readily prescribed. Many of them are already in generic form, which means that the patents have already lapsed on the first versions of those drugs. So when they're available as generic drugs, very often they're available at significantly lower cost? There's a whole discussion to be had there about patent laws and prescription drugs. But because these drugs are largely available in prescription yet generic form, I think there's a great opportunity to explore how hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, and DHA, but a huge category of hormones might impact the symptoms of OCD, especially since many of the symptoms of OCD show up right around the time of puberty.",

And in fact, there are where divergent and convergent thinking and creativity is not assisted by cannabis and might even be reduced by ingesting cannabis. However, if one considers that divergent thinking is absolutely crucial to the creativity process and the range of things that one will explore will be enhanced by openness and by reduced levels of anxiety. So a willingness to explore different options, some of which might seem completely crazy, and cannabis increases the personality types and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness. Well, then it makes perfect sense why cannabis would increase creativity in certain individuals, but not directly. And this study, the one I just referred to, which I should say was published in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, and again, we'll provide a link to it, did a wonderful job of teasing out this impact of cannabis on personality, which then impacts creativity.",

So these neuromodulators can exist in normal levels, low levels, high levels. And that actually gives us a window into a very important aspect of neuroscience history that all of us are impacted by today, which is the discovery of antidepressants and so-called antipsychotics. In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, it was discovered that there are compounds, chemicals, that can increase or decrease serotonin, that can increase or decrease dopamine. And that led to the development of most of what we call antidepressants. Now, the trick here, or the problem, is that most of these drugs, especially in the 1950s and 60s, they would reduce serotonin, but they would also reduce dopamine or they would increase serotonin, but they would also increase some other neuromodulator or chemical.",

I know we didn't talk about that earlier, but sitting with good posture and not kind of slouching or leaning forward can actually really do wonders for your pelvic floor. So focusing on posture is helpful, but also when biking posture is helpful. So they've actually looked at this data and they found that people who aero ride, meaning lean forward, are people who use narrow bike seats are more likely to have issues. And so you want to get kind of a noseless seat and a wider seat. The cutouts, actually, when they've looked at kind of mechanics of the cutouts, they'll see higher pressure around the opening. So it's actually not good to have a bike with a cutout, a bike seat with a cutout, because they've seen, at least with some of the cutouts, that the pressure actually becomes higher on the area that's right around it.

Yet 10,000 bulbs of a thousand watts each have just come on. Only one of these is pointing to work. And so I'm lucky enough that one of them happened to point to my site. So here you activate the bundle, thousands of fibers. I'm lucky enough that some of those happen to do something to make a meaningful difference in depression or to make a meaningful difference in epileptics.

And this study essentially showed, I'll just read the conclusions, that an eight-hour time-restricted feeding produces a mild caloric restriction and weight loss without calorie counting. So that's key, right? These people aren't calorie counting. Somehow just by adhering to an eight hour window, they are taking in fewer calories than they're burning off. And clinically it reduced blood pressure. So I mentioned the study, not because there aren't many others involving the eight hour feeding window, also in humans, but because the eight hour feeding window has been tested in obese adults and non obese adults. And there are even a few studies in children. So this eight hour window seems to be a really good rule of thumb and a kind of anchor around which we can each think about incorporating time restricted feeding.

Remember earlier, in a previous podcast, I said that virtually anything will phase shift your circadian rhythm if it's different and dramatic enough. So the question is, is it the light delivered up the nose or through the ears or some other orifice that's mediating the process? Is it actually tapping into the natural biology of the system that you're trying to manipulate? And this is where I like to distinguish between real biology and hacks.

There is a reinforcement pathway related to that for sort of obvious adaptive reasons. And as a consequence, there is a reinforcement both from the behavior and from the dopamine released from the nicotine itself.

So without knowing your resting blood glucose levels on an individual basis, there's no way I can say for sure that it doesn't break a fast, but chances are it does not because it doesn't contain much carbohydrate or sugar, and it doesn't tend to therefore pull you out of the molecular milieu associated with low blood glucose states.

Now the muscles themselves, skeletal muscles, don't do anything unless the nervous system tells them to do something. And when the nervous system tells them to do something, they contract. So there are specialized neurons in the spinal cord and above the spinal cord, the region called the brainstem, which go to respiratory muscles, in particular for inspiration, the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles in the rib cage, and they contract. So these respiratory muscles, these inspiratory muscles become active, and they become active for a period of time, then they become silent, and when they become silent, the muscles then relax back to their original resting level. Where does that activity in these neurons that innervate the muscle, which are called motor neurons, where does that originate? Well, this was a question that's been bandied around for thousands of years. And when I was a beginning assistant professor, it was fairly high priority for me to try and figure that out because I wanted to understand where this rhythm of breathing was coming from.",

What I've looked at was two journals in particular, International Journal of Chronobiology and Journal Biological Rhythms, excuse me, to assess these parameters that I've mentioned just a moment ago, because the studies tended to be done in humans. They were fairly recent and they came from groups that I recognized as well as knowing that those journals are peer reviewed. Many of your questions were about neural plasticity, which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change in response to experience.

I'm not saying these things as recommendations for increasing one's sense of pleasure. I'm describing them because of what they do generally falls into two categories. The first category is to raise the foundation, what we call the tonic level of dopamine and serotonin.

And perhaps the best way to start talking about this is to go back to the inception of the Human Microbiome Project, which was this program that NIH started. They invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009 for really propelling the field of gut microbiome research. It was becoming evident at that point that this was not just a curiosity of human biology, that it was probably really important for our health. And they had all this wonderful sequencing technology from the Human Genome Sequencing Project. And with the human genome complete at that point, they started turning that technology to sequencing our gut microbes.

But what they do is they pair caffeine with different food sources for the bees. Then they remove the caffeine. And what they find is that the bees very strongly prefer flavors that contain caffeine, not because they could taste the caffeine, but rather for the way that those caffeine containing flavors made the bees feel. So how do those caffeine containing flavors make the bees feel? The same way that they make you and I feel, a little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work. For the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food, which then has a further reinforcing effect. So what we're really talking about here is the fact that A, caffeine exists in nature, in plants. It exists in concentrations that are very low, so low in fact that they are not detectable to the taste receptors of insects, and in many cases to the taste receptors of humans.",

But if you really want to see the maximum performance enhancing effects of caffeine, you will do either one of two things. You will either abstain from caffeine for a few days or three days prior to ingesting caffeine, or you will use caffeine on an empty stomach.

Each one of those is what they call a soleus pushup. This study had people continuously do soleus pushups, and they looked at things like blood glucose utilization, they looked at metabolism and so on. Now, a couple of important things about this study before I tell you what they discovered, which was frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard to believe. And yet I believe the data, the data look to be collected quite well. And there are a lot of statistics and the study looks to be quite thorough.

So definitely using lubricants and always kind of making sure to be in the context, of course, of being consensual, but also like never force, always take take your time and those things are really important to avoid trauma because trauma can happen and usually it's not severe trauma right it's not going to create long-lasting problems but it is you know inconvenient uncomfortable and probably we're not seeing as much of it because they're not coming to the emergency room if they're having issues unless it's really serious um so i think it's really important, one, to prevent from sexually transmitted infections, two, to be thoughtful and cautious.

It's almost kind of scary to think about, but that's how sensitive our system is if we already have somewhat elevated blood glucose from a meal that we ate an hour or so ago. Whereas if we have run for an hour or trained hard, high intensity training, and we haven't quite reached the beginning of our so-called feeding window, will eating a small amount of food take us out of that fast? Well, depends on what the food is. If it's mostly fat, probably not. A number of people out there nowadays talk about so-called fat fasting. Fat fasting is a way to kind of wriggle past the stringency of either eating or not eating as a black and white rule for feeding window versus non-feeding window.

So the way to think about muscle growth and the way to think about muscles getting stronger is that those balloons get bigger and the muscle gets thicker. Now, the question then should be, as always, how does that happen? I mean, the muscle doesn't really know anything about what's happening in the outside world. The way it happens is the nerve, the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger. And it does that through what we call a signaling cascade. It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals.

So for instance, foods with hidden sugars, sugars that have been masked by salty or spicy tastes, increases our desire for glucose elevating foods and food generally. I think that's the only logical interpretation of the data that I can arrive at.",

How should you filter your tap water? Well, you have everything ranging from the so-called Brita type filters. So these are going to be carbon type filters or other filters that you essentially put over a container or a compartment where you can pour the water over it and goes into the compartment below. Will those work? Are they sufficient to filter out the disinfectant byproducts? The general answer is yes, provided you change the filters often enough. However, it is not thought, unfortunately not thought that they filter out sufficient fluoride. So what I highly recommend is depending on your budget, that you go online and you search for at-home water filters that can filter out fluoride. There are a number of straightforward and inexpensive tools to do that.",

And that's because if temperature is too low or too high, then ATP is not going to be available because of this whole thing called the pyruvate kinase pathway and the temperature dependence of pyruvate kinase. Check out that episode if you want to learn more about that, but temperature is important and pH is also important. So we've got nerve, muscle, and then there's stuff in our blood that's available as an energy source. And in blood, we've got glucose, so literally blood sugar that's floating around.

Price elasticity is an economic term that is used to ask the question, if the price of a given good goes up by 1%, that should result in reduction in purchase or consumption because price influences consumption.

I've had trouble over the years falling and staying asleep, or I should say falling asleep hasn't been so much of an issue for me, but waking up two or three or four hours later has been an issue. Oftentimes I'm too warm, I need to open a window, I need to adjust the temperature of the room, and so on. Eight sleep mattress covers are terrific because you can program the specific patterns of temperature that you want in your bed, or I should say below you coming from the mattress throughout the night.

So we did a randomized trial of women with metastatic breast cancer. They had advancing disease. We met with them in a support group once a week and taught them self-hypnosis for stress and anxiety and pain control at the end. And by the end of a year, the treatment group had half the pain the control group did on the same and very low amounts of medication. So it lasts.

And in order to master that process, we need to embrace another mindset. That's right. In order to access growth mindset, it's very clear that we need to be able to think about errors and we need to overcome errors and we need to devote our attention to errors and we need to devote our attention to reframing what's going on in our head when we're feeling not motivated, et cetera.

I'm going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression. For instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression, meaning sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love who also feel threatened. There's also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others. And there is indirect aggression, which is aggression not involving physical violence, for instance, shaming people and things of that sort. It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression. And today I will define those for you. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression. Talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved.

By focusing on that particular location and by forcing yourself to refocus on that location, anytime your gaze, your vision drifts from that location, you are encouraging the circuits for focus to get better at focusing for longer and longer and at refocusing when your focus drifts off of that location. This is incorporating neural circuits, including the prefrontal cortex, things like the frontal eye fields. For those of you curious about the underlying biology, this practice is recruiting certain elements of your so-called prefrontal cortex, also the frontal eye fields, which are locations not far from the prefrontal cortex that are involved in deliberately directing your gaze to particular locations in space, not outer space, although you could do this by focusing on stars, I suppose, but in visual space. Now, I mentioned before that this is overt visual focus and attention. You are overtly looking at that location, but one also very powerful practice for improving focus and concentration is to use covert focus.

And in fact, areas of the brain that are associated with visual imagery, such as the visual or so-called occipital cortex and the parietal cortex has been shown in other studies to ramp up when people are motionless. So there seems to be this inverse relationship between movement and visual imagery, which makes sense. When we're moving, we can pay attention to things in the outside world. We tend to be aware of our sensory environment to varying degrees, but we don't tend to be very focused on visual imagery within our head. Whereas when we lie down or sit down and close our eyes and we are motionless, the degree of visual imagery really increases.

The neuromodulators by contrast, so not neurotransmitters, but neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and acetylcholine, and others, operate a little bit differently.

And we'll talk about that a little bit later and how to offset some of those health issues. Okay, so now let's talk about the flu virus. The flu virus is, as I mentioned, a virus. And just like with the cold, there are different serotypes of the flu virus. There are also different general categories of flu virus. So you've got your A-type flu viruses, your B-type flu viruses, and your C-type flu viruses. And by the way, I'm saying flu viruses, but of course I'm referring to influenza, but it's just kind of commonplace nowadays to refer to influenza as the flu. Similar to cold viruses, the different types of flu viruses exist based on the different types of proteins that they express on their surface. In fact, in the news over the last few years, there have been a number of different flu virus strains that have been described according to their surface protein characteristics. Things like the H1N1 virus. What is H1N1?",

So in that context, it's important for us not to just distinguish tenacity and willpower from habit execution, but also draw out a continuum with tenacity and willpower at their most extreme on one end of that continuum and apathy and yes, depression on the other end of that continuum. And we will return to the topic of depression a little bit later, but I can just cue it up right now by saying that one of the hallmark features of major depression is a lack of positive anticipation about the future that leads to, this is important, there's a verb tense here, that leads to a much lower tendency to engage in the specific types of behavior that would allow one to arrive at a particular new, different, and positive future.",

However, the static protocols showed significant gains with a P value less than 0.05, which means a probability that cannot be explained by chance alone when compared to ballistic or PNF protocols. So again, what we're hearing is that static stretching is the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion.

And she ovulates at about the midpoint of her cycle. So if we're just going to make the math easy, on day 14, she's going to release a follicle from one of her ovaries. And the estrogen level is sort of rising, rising, rising. We love to measure hormones on day five because I want to have a standardized way in which I measure her hormones. So our women know if we're in the business of trying to understand her hormones, the day her period starts, even if it's just a day of spotting, that becomes our benchmark. And then day five, I want to see every hormone on that day. And if everything is going well, I know what her FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone should be on that day. So the estrogen rises, starts to come down a little bit as she ovulates, and then the luteinizing hormone kicks on because it's now going to prepare her uterus for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy.",

There's a heritable component, but it accounts for, my recollection is on the order of 30, 40% of the variability in perfect pitch. However, if people receive ear training starting at a young age, the chance that they will develop perfect pitch can improve drastically. In your book, Unique, do you cover aspects of human individuality that extend beyond the perception domain into the cognitive domain? Well, yeah, absolutely. And, you know, I think it's good to set the stage here if we're going to be talking about heritability and human individuality.

There's a lot of debate about exactly what the dentate gyrus does, but for sake of this discussion, and I think everyone in the neuroscience community would agree that the dentate gyrus is important for memory formation and consolidation. The dentate gyrus does seem to be one region of the brain, certainly in the rodent brain, but more and more it's seeming also in the human brain where at least some new neurons are added throughout the lifespan. And as it turns out that cardiovascular exercise can increase the proliferation of new neurons in this structure and that those new neurons, excuse me, are important for the formation of certain types of new memories.",
